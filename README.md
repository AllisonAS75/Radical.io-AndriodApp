This application will allow us to verify an email address from an Edit Text and after a Check Validity button is pressed, it verifies the email address and shows a message in android toast to see if it was a valid or invaild email address.

It also allows us to change the background color of our activiy using a Switch. If the switch is on, it will set the color as Cyan and if the switch is off, it will set the color as Magenta. By default the color is white.

This applocation has 2 activities (screens). The first activity has a button names 'Next Activity' which allows us to goto the next Activity. The 2nd activity called 'ImageView' has an ImageView Control which shows an Image and it also has a button which takes us to the previous activity.
